# RESTAPI
PARTA
. A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by computer scientist Roy Fielding. That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating and deleting of operations concerning resources. The interface must uniquely identify each resource involved in the interaction between the client and the server.
Manipulation of resources through representations â€“ The resources should have uniform representations in the server response. API consumers should use these representations to modify the resources state in the server.
